# Food-Vision
-- A Deep Learning webapp which uses EfficientNetB0 and Keras pretrained model ResNet50 to predict food images 

-- Uses Flask, HTML, CSS, JS and Heroku for deployement.

-- We end up with a Flask-powered web application (Food Vision 🍔👁) for classifying images of food (deployed on Heroku).

-- Our app running locally making a prediction on an image of pizza (using a pretrained Keras powered ResNet50 model).
